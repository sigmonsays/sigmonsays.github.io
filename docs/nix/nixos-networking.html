  <article><h1 id="bridged-networking">Bridged Networking <a class="anchor" href="#bridged-networking"> </a></h1>
<p>I recently switched my main desktop from ubuntu to nixos. So I started down the road of attempting<br />
to run virtual machines on nixos as a development stack.</p>
<p><code>All I want for christmas is a bridged network</code></p>
<p>all I wanted is a bridged network to have VMs DHCP on my LAN.</p>
<p>One development stack I use is a VM filled with a bunch of services. That way I can setup<br />
and install the machine just like a production node. Acurately representing the deployment<br />
makes development and testing easier. Often this setup is used as some type of integration<br />
testing or performance testing.</p>
<p>But enough about that&hellip; and onto setting up a bridged network on nixos!</p>
<p>So I spent a little looking around on how to setup bridged networking with very<br />
little fruitful results. I didn&rsquo;t want to use networkd right away but i was guided<br />
that way on the nixos chat because the configuration directives are documented<br />
by networkd and we all know the state of nixos documentation.</p>
<p>I ran into some issues along the way</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> took really long to configure networkd. This made feedback painful because trying things took a while.</li>
<li>nixos networking documentation is subpar, atleast very confusing at the minimum</li>
<li>documentation is pretty much missing on setting up common deployments. You&rsquo;re forced to look at<br />
a set of options and put them together to make something that works.</li>
<li>i first looked for bridged networking using the networking.* set of options but was unable to find a complete example</li>
<li>nixos-rebuild switch does not always work. This is the first time the configuration was not applied to the running system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More on configuration not being applied to the running system</strong></p>
<p>whatever happened i&rsquo;m not sure, i had to reboot the box for the network to come up properly. I discovered this by making a nixos VM and configuring it just like I did before. miraculously<br />
it worked!</p>
<p>I thought WTH did i do wrong&hellip; At the end of the day I was fed up with the amount of time I put into it and wanted to move on. So I did.</p>
<h2 id="dns-fun">dns fun <a class="anchor" href="#dns-fun"> </a></h2>
<p>Second big woes was DNS</p>
<ul>
<li>first i tried &rsquo;networking.search&rsquo; and that did nothing</li>
<li>then i tried &lsquo;services.resolved.domains = [ &ldquo;lan&rdquo; ]&rsquo; and that didn&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>then i tried &lsquo;systemd.network.networks.<name>.domains&rsquo; and that finally worked</li>
<li>getting &lsquo;search lan&rsquo; functionality is surprisingly difficult</li>
<li>somehow i was automatically switched over to &lsquo;resolved&rsquo; functionality (services.resolved.enable) when enabling systemd.network</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="working-configuration">Working configuration <a class="anchor" href="#working-configuration"> </a></h1>
<p>The final configration that setup bridged networking for my host</p>
<pre><code>    # This network config uses sytemd networkd with a bridge
    {
    networking.hostName = &quot;desktop3&quot;;
    networking = {
        useDHCP = false;
        useNetworkd = true;
    };
    systemd.network = {
        enable = true;
        netdevs = {
            &quot;25-br0&quot; = {
                netdevConfig = {
                    Kind = &quot;bridge&quot;;
                    Name = &quot;br0&quot;;
                };
            };
        };
        networks = {
            &quot;30-br0&quot; = {
                matchConfig.Name = &quot;en*&quot;;
                networkConfig = {
                    Bridge = &quot;br0&quot;;
                };
            };
            &quot;40-br0&quot; = {
                DHCP = &quot;yes&quot;;
                matchConfig.Name = &quot;br0&quot;;
            };
        };
    };

    # Wait for any interface to become available, not for all
    systemd.services.&quot;systemd-networkd-wait-online&quot;.serviceConfig.ExecStart = [
        &quot;&quot; &quot;${config.systemd.package}/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd-wait-online --any&quot;
    ];
    }

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts <a class="anchor" href="#final-thoughts"> </a></h1>
<p>I think that nixos might be the best OS i&rsquo;ve used in terms of reproducibility.</p>
<p>I usually dont have a lot of problem these days with ubuntu but having to upgrade between distributions and set everything back up was a pain. Mostly because I didn&rsquo;t remember what<br />
I wanted until I needed it right away. There was some things that were old on ubuntu like i3, tmux and polybar that I would compile from source.</p>
<p>I dont even have a complete list of everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attempted to salt or ansible my desktop and development environments but those tools<br />
required more effort than I was willing to put in.</p>
<p>So all that being said, I hope this blog post helps someone on their nixos adventures.</p>
