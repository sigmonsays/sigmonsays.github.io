<p>I have switched to i3wm (for some time now) exclusively due to its speed and lightweight. I'll have to write a post about that experience
some time.</p>
<h1>e20</h1>
<p>enlightenment has been my window manager of choice for a very long time maintly because of its speed. I used to run
window maker and then fluxbox before I made the switch to enlightenment (0.16 at the time iirc).</p>
<h1>e20 - feb2016</h1>
<p>enlightnement 0.20 caused all sorts of graphics problems</p>
<p>i tried a bunch of different things, like hardware and software rendering without luck</p>
<p>the problems I had were many</p>
<ul>
<li>chrome kept freezing which only began happening in the new e. I managed to work around it by disabling GL in chrome</li>
<li>pidgin systray icon went away</li>
<li>sluggish UI after hours of usage</li>
<li>while using hardware rendering, windows would just render bloack
<ul>
<li>no matter what I did, restart e, minimize/shade/move window, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>while using software rendering
<ul>
<li>really high cpu usage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>under both hardware and software I would see windows flickering all the time
<ul>
<li>windows would not redraw properly quite item</li>
<li>notably xterm which is just not acceptable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an attempt to keep an ongoing document that describes the issues and fixes i've encountered.</p>
