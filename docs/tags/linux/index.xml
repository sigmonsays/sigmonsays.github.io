      <description>Table of Contents&#xA;why dotbot why dotbot is a tool to manage dot files. I wrote this tool after gettting tired of futzing around with the python dotbot from https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot. Full disclosure I love this tool and it&amp;rsquo;s the motivation for the development of my own dotbot.&#xA;I had two main issues that were annoying to me. First, git submodules were a part of the bootstrap process. Second, I always needed some yaml dependancy installed.</description>

      <description>Update: August 2019 I have switched to i3wm (for some time now) exclusively due to its speed and lightweight. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to write a post about that experience some time.&#xA;e20 enlightenment has been my window manager of choice for a very long time maintly because of its speed. I used to run window maker and then fluxbox before I made the switch to enlightenment (0.16 at the time iirc).</description>
