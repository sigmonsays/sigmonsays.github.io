on a linux desktop.</p>
<p>The primary use case for these requirements are a dual screen workstation. The screens are both 4k screens,
which rules out tiling since tiling with such high resolution (3840x2160) breaks down quickly.</p>
<p>This workstation is a desktop and my primary working environment.</p>
<p><strong>Current solution</strong></p>
<p>My current solution is to use i3 and float everything. Prior to floating everything, my 2 screens were smaller
and I had far less screen space. Tiling actually made sense back then but with 4k screens it does not.</p>
<p><strong>Previous solutions</strong></p>
<p>Prior to i3 I was a heavy enlightenment user but it ended up having some missing features</p>
<p>I used awesome-wm for a little but having to write lua was a huge pain. interoperability issues like
not being able to use polybar cause more pain. At some pinot I had memory leaks and the complicated
code to do simple things hurt. Still I had an awesome window manger setup with awesome-wm (pun intended)</p>
<h1>Common Features</h1>
<p><strong>Configurable Key bindings</strong></p>
<p>This should go without saying but i definitely need to be able to configure key bindings as I am primarily
a keyboard user with very little mouse usage.</p>
<h1>Workspaces</h1>
<p>I will always have the need to move applications to a workspace I do not see.</p>
<p>I have a machine with a lot of memory and will have multiple development environments open and maybe
a remote/production workspace as well. The first workspace is usually e-mail and chat.</p>
<p>A common setup is as follows</p>
<p><strong>Screen 1 (left) - workspaces 1 through 5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>workspace 1
<ul>
<li>browser w/ work chat programs</li>
<li>browser w/ work email and calendar programs</li>
<li>terminal with meetings notes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workspace 2
<ul>
<li>code on primary project</li>
<li>usually many terminals, 3 to 4 is common</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workspace 3
<ul>
<li>sometimes ssh remote sessions</li>
<li>sometimes adhoc coding projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workspace 4
<ul>
<li>whatever overflows like additional projects</li>
<li>production or development deployments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workspace 5
<ul>
<li>steam games</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Screen 2 (right) - workspaces 6 through 9 and 0</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>workspace 6
<ul>
<li>personal chats</li>
<li>personal email</li>
<li>music (spotify or youtube)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workspace 7
<ul>
<li>gui notes program (sublime text)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workspace 8
<ul>
<li>sometimes GUI REST API tool like bruno</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workspace 9
<ul>
<li>whatever</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workspace 10
<ul>
<li>mindmapping</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Independent workspaces per screen</h1>
<p>This single requirement rules out so many window managers.</p>
<p>Being able to switch a workspace on a single monitor is such a big deal.</p>
<p>Quite often I have documentation or chat up on one screen that I am keeping an eye on and then code
or work on the other screen.</p>
<p>This is a critical part of my workflow that I really think is necessary on a desktop workstation</p>
<p>This list of window managers that can do this are short, some of them are bspwm, awesome-wm, i3,
enlightenment, xmonad, wingo, dwm, and cosmic.</p>
<h1>Scratch pad</h1>
<p>A scratch pad is a window that you can show and hide quickly that is always running.</p>
<p>I have multiple scratch pads each bound to a key</p>
<ul>
<li>terminal</li>
<li>math terminal - usually running python or qcalc</li>
<li>file browser</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a terminal called tdrop which can provide a quake like inspired terminal but that does not
cover other applications like file browsers.</p>
<h1>Easily configurable from dot files</h1>
<p>the window manager needs a cli to configure it or have configuration files to control most things.</p>
<p>enlightenment failed this one, being able to configure everything from a git checkout was ultimately what
made me look for alternatives.</p>
<p>That and it was rather old and appeared to be slowly unmaintained. I used to compile it from source to get
the version I wanted.</p>
<h1>Powerful Launcher</h1>
<p>current launcher is rofi, it lets me run arbitrary commands which is pretty useful as I would rather write a script
as opposed to a .desktop file.</p>
<p>Rofi does more than just run commands, it also does ssh, open windows, and emoji</p>
<h1>Menu Bar</h1>
<p>currently use polybar as it has a lot of features I like</p>
<ul>
<li>Various monitors - I have CPU, Memory, Disk, download speed, VPN and Interface stats.</li>
<li>load average</li>
<li>volume control, which is critical</li>
<li>current date</li>
<li>current weather</li>
</ul>
