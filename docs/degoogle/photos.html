<h1 id="introduction">Introduction <a class="anchor" href="#introduction"> </a></h1>
<p>Google photos was amazing in the beginning, the photos application did what I wanted and in general it was a good experience</p>
<p>I was somewhat of an early adopter, so I had a plethora of photos stored in google photos.  I didn&rsquo;t really<br />
have to think about photos, it was just handled for me.</p>
<p>Some of the features were pretty useful such as facial recognition and automatic event creation but they didn&rsquo;t<br />
really end up being needed.</p>
<h1 id="walled-garden">Walled garden <a class="anchor" href="#walled-garden"> </a></h1>
<p>A series of decisions were made by google, which I do not care to fully understand. When they stopped<br />
supporting integrations and tightened the walled garden, my concern grew.</p>
<p>I was trying to use rclone to backup my photos, but google removed the ability to access the originals. That is via the<br />
API any downloaded images will not be in the original resolution or quality. Other tools (like drive) fell short as they continued<br />
to lock my data up.</p>
<p>At one point photos could be accessed from google drive, but that was also removed.</p>
<p>The exact order of events evades me but what was demonstrated time and time again was they wanted me stuck there.</p>
<p>I began to care more about security after realizing that I am the product if the service is free. Google can and will use<br />
metadata it collects from photos. This includes not only location but facial recognition of you and anyone else in the photo.</p>
<p>because of general security concerns, I do not like giving facial recognition and location to any corporation, let alone google.</p>
<p>I began looking for alternatives. I do not want anyone<br />
I take a photo of (directly or indirectly) being indexed. It is very big brother.</p>
<p>The final straw was when I ran out of space and was told I needed to buy more. So I cleaned up some data to buy some time, did a photos takeout<br />
and begin my research.</p>
<h1 id="the-solution">The solution <a class="anchor" href="#the-solution"> </a></h1>
<p>use <a href="#syncthing">Syncthing</a> to copy originals from my phone to my server</p>
<p>use <a href="#picman">picman</a> as a way to automatically import and organize the photos on my NAS</p>
<p>use <a href="#photoprism">photoprism</a> as a webUI to look at photos</p>
<h1 id="syncthing">syncthing <a class="anchor" href="#syncthing"> </a></h1>
<p>syncthing was chosen as a way to have more control over the photos being copied between devices. I didn&rsquo;t want any software in the middle modifying<br />
the photo (resizing it like google docs, transcoding it, etc).</p>
<p>Most if not all photo solutions support an external folder, so I can just import the originals</p>
<p>syncthing is pretty straight forward to setup, so I wont go into the details here.</p>
<h1 id="picman">picman <a class="anchor" href="#picman"> </a></h1>
<p>I wrote a program that lets me import photos into a folder structure of <code>Year/Month</code> by reading exif data</p>
<p>This program simply runs from a cron and imports from various syncthing sources</p>
<p>picman runs from a cronjob and imports photos every 30 minutes.</p>
<h1 id="photoprism">photoprism <a class="anchor" href="#photoprism"> </a></h1>
<p>This is the interface I settled on.</p>
<p>It seems stable enough and does the job well. I turned off facial recognition and other AI type features.</p>
<p>I deploy this on my server using docker-compose</p>
<h1 id="honorable-mention-photostructure">honorable mention: Photostructure <a class="anchor" href="#honorable-mention-photostructure"> </a></h1>
<p>I want to mention photostructure because I really liked the UI and UX, but I spent too much time<br />
trying to get it working and be stable.</p>
<p>The TLDR is it would randomly hang and stop importing and I could never figure out know why. I think<br />
it has some issues on large videos of large HEIC files.</p>
