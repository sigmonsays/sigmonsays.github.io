      <description>Table of Contents
 why dotbot  why dotbot is a tool to manage dot files. I wrote this tool after gettting tired of futzing around with the python dotbot from https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot. Full disclosure I love this tool and it&amp;rsquo;s the motivation for the development of my own dotbot.
I had two main issues that were annoying to me. First, git submodules were a part of the bootstrap process. Second, I always needed some yaml dependancy installed.</description>

      <description>I have been a go programmer before go 1.0 was released, I think that brings me back to beginning writing go code around 2011. as en exercise I wrote a simple daemon to handle some backend work where concurrency was key and have enjoyed developing it for quite some time. It replaced a python process where many actors needed to operate on a workqueue. This daemon is actually still in produciton today =P</description>

transcript ------------------------------- we pushed the images to dockerhub, then used docker-compose to deploy to the cluster we mounted data volumes on these nodes and linked app container here finally we&#39;ve updated the DNS records hitler: so we&#39;re running 20 containers on every node now. when can we get rid of the excess servers? mein fuhrer... the kernel... A 3rd party container caused a panic... we&#39;ve lost 70% of the cluster and the data volumes .</description>

      <description>I heard from a friend about an interesting interview question that I thought would be easy.
The problem
the goal of this program is to find the shortest number of stickers used to make a another word given that you have thousands of stickers
for instance, with the word &amp;ldquo;WPENGINE&amp;rdquo; printed on them to make for example &amp;ldquo;WWW&amp;rdquo; would take 3 and another example is &amp;ldquo;WINE&amp;rdquo; would take 1.
The programs logic is really quite literal and was enjoyable to write.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure anyone who has been on IRC or any type of chat understands the concept of a no paste service.
It has always been bothersome to me that any paste, or &amp;ldquo;no paste&amp;rdquo; command line client has to be needlessly complex. Some i&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use in the past have required installing ruby gems which I despise. So to scratch an itch, I wrote my very own which requires nothing more than curl.</description>

      <description>git watch is a simple library and CLI tool for monitoring git repositories and triggering events (restart process) when they change.
git watch [1] was designed as a way to easily build and deploy daemons in development when upstream changes. The changes can be either code (in git) or configuration.
So here is a simple example which will automatically rebuild and restart a application when you git push (https://github.com/sigmonsays/git-watch/tree/master/examples/go)
Below in git-watch.</description>

      <description>python is a incredibly useful language and has a powerful type system which can be pretty convenient. I&amp;rsquo;ve written python for many years now and when I need a quick tool, most the time I write it in python.
These tools have built up over time and i&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting them organically into a python startup file as a set of libraries and functions.
create a file in $HOME/.pythonstartup and cherry pick anything below that you find useful.</description>

      <description>updates   Nov2014 - an exploit in systemd resolver - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8595335
 Just another reason to do one thing well and not try to do too much. C&amp;rsquo;mon systemd, focus. Please help me understand why a init.d replacement needs to provide a resolver. some gems from this thread  &amp;ldquo;I find the design of systemd-resolved to be very strange. It uses dbus to talk to glibc, and it seems to be a new, from-scratch implementation of a DNS resolver.</description>

      <title>building packages with docker</title>

      <description>This is a simple idea I had while waiting for a build to complete.
The background Its common to use dpkg-buildpackage inside of a chroot managed by pdebuild. The pdebuild script takes a minimal base image tarball and installs all dependencies in it required to build your package.
The build dependencies come from debian/control Build-Depends section. The package being built is a python application using virtualenv. A lot of the packages come from apt however.</description>

      <description>things I find that I wish docker supported
dockerfile   store build context with the image
 provides ability to change original dockerfile for images you download saves dockerfile and other build artifacts similar in concept to a &amp;ldquo;source package&amp;rdquo;    support for variables
There is very little that the dockerfile actually supports beyond basic static directives.
If dockerfile supported templates and variables, we could allow repetitive lines to be reduced to the bare minimum.</description>

      <description>While trying to determine the performance overhead of a simple docker container setup, I discovered several issues related to network performance.
two issues I have encountered
 docker-proxy handles local network traffic when using the hosts bridge IP (or localhost) connection tracking overhead of NAT increases memory usage  my setup
I am using docker containers as an easy way to deploy backends on a host. I wish to use the hosts bridge IP as a backend to route requests from the load balancer.</description>
