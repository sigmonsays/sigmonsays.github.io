<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>I've been using doom-emacs for over a year now (since March 2021) and this is my personal experiences with it.</p>
<p>I do not put a ton of effort into editors, rather I spend a chunk of time intermittently. This has happened with vi/vim and again
with emacs. my vim configuration was always flaky and never worked correctly until around neovim. At that point I was so fed up
with reproducible editor configuration that I looked for something better.</p>
<p>Here is my editor timeline</p>

<h1>Pico and Nano</h1>
<p>As a systems administration and a PHP developer, I primarily built CMS type stacks and shopping cart applications. These
editors worked well but I found myself wasting so much time navigating with page up and page down</p>
<h1>Vim</h1>
<p>When I discovered vim and what it could do, I became interested.. But...</p>
<p>It was really difficult for me to pick up. Once I managed to make the switch to a modal editor, I never
looked back.</p>
<p>vim configuration was always mystical to me (and still is). I could barely customize it outside of it's
stock configuration so that's what I used.</p>
<h1>doom emacs</h1>
<p>Being a vim user for so many years has basically burned those keys into my brain.</p>
<p>I am still a vim user to this day like using <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> to navigate is still present in doom emacs due to evil mode</p>
<p>I'm by no means a lisp expert but doom emacs is ready to go out very quickly. Some things that look time are learning
and discovering everything that is out there.</p>

<h1>emacs28 with native compilation</h1>
<p>The editor install is a beast which is not ideal but native compilation made emacs so much faster that I can't live without it</p>
<h1>Markdown mode</h1>
<p>Emacs never fails to amaze in the commands it has. One case is in markdown mode, you can simply run <code>markdown-toc-generate-toc</code> and it will generate
a index at the top of the page. This also works for org mode using <code>toc-org-insert-toc</code></p>
<h1>Org mode and babel</h1>
<p>I use .org files for keeping notes about various things. Being able to have a text only interface with the ability to link between org files and sections
is really all I need.</p>
<p>Then comes babel, which is a way for emacs to execute source code snippets. For instance for bash, I can get the output of <code>df -h /</code> rendered directly in
my org file</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src bash :results output
df -h /
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
: /dev/nvme0n1p2  1.8T  473G  1.3T  28% /
</code></pre>
<p>I've used this for a lot of things where you want to remember the command and also capture the results.</p>
