<pre><code>transcript
-------------------------------

we pushed the images to dockerhub, then used docker-compose to deploy to the cluster

we mounted data volumes on these nodes

and linked app container here

finally we've updated the DNS records


hitler: so we're running 20 containers on every node now. when can we get rid of the excess servers?

mein fuhrer...

the kernel...
A 3rd party container caused a panic...

we've lost 70% of the cluster and the data volumes

.... hitler loses his shit ....

hitler: if you never used docker in production, leave the room now

hitler: isolation my ass!

hitler: what were you thinking?

hitler: who the hell uses public containers from docker hub?

hitler: for all you know they were made by russian hackers!

hitler: you might as well use `curl | sudo bash`

hitler: you think everything in public rpeo is secure because it's OSS?

hitler: you're a bunch of node.js hipsters that just HAVE to install everything you read on hacker news!

but docker allows us to run our applications anywhere!

hitler: you use a VM just to run docker on your laptop!

mein fuhrer, docker-machine uses a lightweight VM!

hitler: do you hear yourself? why do we need docker if we're running a VM?

hitler: a container inside a container!!!

hitler: you archived a whole linux O/S then used CoW storage becaues it's too big

hitler: Just so you can deploy a 10MB go Binary!

hitler: Dont even talk to me about resource constraints

hitler: all that cgroups black magic and it still can't stop a simple fork bomb!

hitler: and if the database needs all the resources on the server, how exactly will docker allow you to run more programs on it?

hitler: before docker, I just picked the right size VMs.

hitler: Suddenly people talk to me about datacenter efficiency and &quot;hyperconvergence&quot;

hitler: everybody thinkst they're google!

hitler: you don't even run your own machines anymore!

hitler: people run docker on GCE, in VM instances that run in linux containers on Borg!

hitler: people even think docker is configuration management

hitler: they think docker solves everything!

hitler: even microsoft has containers now

hitler: i'm moving everyone to windows!

dont cry, you can run bash on windows 10 now

hitler: docker is supposed to have better performance

hitler: yet that fucker userland proxy is slower than a 28.8k modem

hitler: and for what

hitler: just bind on port 0

hitler: even enterprises want to run docker now and they still have red hat 5 installed

hitler: you idiots think docker will help your application scale

hitler: use openstack for all I care
