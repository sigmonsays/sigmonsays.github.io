  <article><p>Pinterest is awful.</p>
<p>This has been growing for years. Here is the typical situation I think more people run into than you think. When you are looking for an image<br />
on google image search and find what you are looking for by thumbnail, and click through just to be taken to pinterest.com. Once you land here,<br />
you do not see any fragment of what you came for. Instead, you are confronted with a sign up page.</p>
<p>This has happened so many times to me and ive ranted to my friends about it before. However, It happened again recently and I also happened to read about it<br />
later. So I am taking it upon myself to make this post, hopefully as a way to contribute to a small change: Pinterest not sucking.</p>
<p><code>Pinterest Sucks</code></p>
<p>They require you to sign up for accounts to see any content yet manage to infect the SEO system of google search results. Both regular<br />
results are affected but also image search.</p>
<p>Even after logging into Pinterest, the image does not show. They are nothing more than click bait.</p>
<p>They probably dont realize it but their decision is probably costing them accounts. I will never sign up for a pinterest account because of the terrible<br />
user experience.</p>
<p>I can never find what im looking for. There is never a working link back to the original source.  Everything they do is garbage. They are the next generation<br />
spammer.</p>
<p>If you want ideas on coffee tables and want to look at a bunch of photos for ideas, they fit. However getting anything meaningful out of pinterest via search<br />
is an exercise in futility.</p>
<p><code>Pinterest is a broken model</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its not just that Pinterest is spamming google searches, and that you have to search again once you get to Pinterest (assuming you have an account and are logged in).<br />
Its also the fact that the majority of Pins are BROKEN- they dont lead back to the original source. (Whether because the pins are old, content has been moved, etc.)<br />
So as opposed to a search engine like Google that continuously updates its index, the Pinterest model will only lead to more and more broken links as time goes by.<br />
It is a broken model, and incredibly frustrating.</p>
