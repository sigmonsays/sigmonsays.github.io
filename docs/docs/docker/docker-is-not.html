    <h1>Docker is not what I want</h1>
  </header>
  <article><p>I have used docker for a while now and consider it a useful piece of software. It helped introduce<br />
containers to the masses but the projects scope has changed and the software is suffering.</p>
<p>Docker is not what I want and here is a quick summary and then I will explain each in detail</p>
<ul>
<li>The future of your app is tied to the future of Docker</li>
<li>Docker is insecure, the entire daemon runs as root</li>
<li>When docker crashes so does every one of your containers</li>
<li>Docker is missing features</li>
<li>Docker is greedy for market</li>
<li>Project is ignoring bugs and performance issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The future of your app is tied to the future of docker</strong></p>
<p>docker has stopped focusing on fixing bugs or performance improvements and instead is<br />
moving into clustering (swarm) or provisioning (machine). While these are necessary features it just shows that docker<br />
is greey for market share and not really trying to make quality software.</p>
<p><strong>docker is insecure, the entire daemon runs as root</strong></p>
<p>not much else to say here, running complete applications as root is not safe.</p>
<p>Any exploit in the daemon gives root access. Containers are not secure and more work is needed to make them secure. Running<br />
all containers as root leaves little to no security. Breaking out of a container from an application is pretty easy so you<br />
can not really trust third party containers.</p>
<p>Containers can run as unprivelleged users but docker does not support it.</p>
<p><strong>When docker crashes so does every one of your containers</strong></p>
<p>a namespace will exist as long as a single process in it does. This means that you do not need a single<br />
daemon running as a parent of all your containers. When you stop or restart the docker daemon all your containers<br />
will die. Any bug in the docker daemon which causes it to crash or run out of memory will kill all your containers.</p>
<p>That is unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Docker is already missing features</strong></p>
<p>For docker getting the head start is is missing a lot of features. Since it decided to drop lxc it is already missing<br />
valuable features like unprivileged containers or CRIU.</p>
<p><strong>Docker is greedy for market</strong></p>
<p>They removed their manifesto and are already focusing on building more poor quality software to get the market share</p>
<p>They market that docker images are &ldquo;like git&rdquo; but this is far from the truth. The project provides no features what so<br />
ever that git does. Adopting the terminology push and pull almost seems like a clever marketing decision. So me how<br />
to branch an image or show a unified diff that someone can merge into their &ldquo;repo&rdquo; if you even had some a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Project is ignoring bugs and critical performance issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>docker-proxy performs software proxy</li>
</ul>
<p>docker-proxy is a socket server which is spawned for each container. It performs software proxy between container ports<br />
host ports in specific cases. It performs so poorly that you see up to a 40x penalty when talking to nginx.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom is key</strong></p>
<p>Containers are gaining popularity so quickly because it allows freedom to move applications between<br />
cloud providers with no extra overhead. Docker is not spending any time contributing any standards for future<br />
interoperation and freedom and instead is focusing only on market share.</p>
<p>Freedom of container solution is also key. As always you must use the right tool for the job. Supporting<br />
more than one container format is important.</p>
