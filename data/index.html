        I have been a go programmer before go 1.0 was released, I think that brings me back to beginning writing go code around 2011. as en exercise I wrote a simple daemon to handle some backend work where concurrency was key and have enjoyed developing it for quite some time. It replaced a python process where many actors needed to operate on a workqueue. This daemon is actually still in produciton today =P

transcript ------------------------------- we pushed the images to dockerhub, then used docker-compose to deploy to the cluster we mounted data volumes on these nodes and linked app container here finally we've updated the DNS records hitler: so we're running 20 containers on every node now. when can we get rid of the excess servers? mein fuhrer... the kernel... A 3rd party container caused a panic... we've lost 70% of the cluster and the data volumes .

        I heard from a friend about an interesting interview question that I thought would be easy.
The problem
the goal of this program is to find the shortest number of stickers used to make a another word given that you have thousands of stickers
for instance, with the word &ldquo;WPENGINE&rdquo; printed on them to make for example &ldquo;WWW&rdquo; would take 3 and another example is &ldquo;WINE&rdquo; would take 1.
The programs logic is really quite literal and was enjoyable to write.

        I&rsquo;m sure anyone who has been on IRC or any type of chat understands the concept of a no paste service.
It has always been bothersome to me that any paste, or &ldquo;no paste&rdquo; command line client has to be needlessly complex. Some i&rsquo;ve tried to use in the past have required installing ruby gems which I despise. So to scratch an itch, I wrote my very own which requires nothing more than curl.

        git watch is a simple library and CLI tool for monitoring git repositories and triggering events (restart process) when they change.
git watch [1] was designed as a way to easily build and deploy daemons in development when upstream changes. The changes can be either code (in git) or configuration.
So here is a simple example which will automatically rebuild and restart a application when you git push (https://github.com/sigmonsays/git-watch/tree/master/examples/go)
Below in git-watch.

        python is a incredibly useful language and has a powerful type system which can be pretty convenient. I&rsquo;ve written python for many years now and when I need a quick tool, most the time I write it in python.
These tools have built up over time and i&rsquo;ve been collecting them organically into a python startup file as a set of libraries and functions.
create a file in $HOME/.pythonstartup and cherry pick anything below that you find useful.

        updates  Nov2014 - an exploit in systemd resolver - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8595335
 Just another reason to do one thing well and not try to do too much. C&rsquo;mon systemd, focus. Please help me understand why a init.d replacement needs to provide a resolver. some gems from this thread  &ldquo;I find the design of systemd-resolved to be very strange. It uses dbus to talk to glibc, and it seems to be a new, from-scratch implementation of a DNS resolver.
