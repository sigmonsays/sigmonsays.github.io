      <description>python is a incredibly useful language and has a powerful type system which can be pretty convenient. I&amp;rsquo;ve written python for many years now and when I need a quick tool, most the time I write it in python.
These tools have built up over time and i&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting them organically into a python startup file as a set of libraries and functions.
create a file in $HOME/.pythonstartup and cherry pick anything below that you find useful.</description>
