      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure anyone who has been on IRC or any type of chat understands the concept of a no paste service.
It has always been bothersome to me that any paste, or &amp;ldquo;no paste&amp;rdquo; command line client has to be needlessly complex. Some i&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use in the past have required installing ruby gems which I despise. So to scratch an itch, I wrote my very own which requires nothing more than curl.</description>

      <description>git watch is a simple library and CLI tool for monitoring git repositories and triggering events (restart process) when they change.
git watch [1] was designed as a way to easily build and deploy daemons in development when upstream changes. The changes can be either code (in git) or configuration.
So here is a simple example which will automatically rebuild and restart a application when you git push (https://github.com/sigmonsays/git-watch/tree/master/examples/go)
Below in git-watch.</description>
