# go jira

https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/go-jira

I currently use this program in a very limited fashion for managing development workflow. it becomes very handy to build a 
shell script environment for aiding in common development process. Right now its only used to view jira tasks and comment on
them. 

This is powerful enough for the time being

# http2 keylog

with the growing popularity of http/2 you can't be without the ability to inspect the payload. 

This looks really useful in tracing http/2 (even grpc) with wireshark

# xo

# teleport

its a pretty impressive ssh daemon setup that has temporary certs for ssh access through a central auth system, with 2-factor 
auth built in. Every "teleport node" registers itself too so you can just list specific nodes 

I can imagine something like this becoming "the normal" in a cloud computing environment

# toasteroid

1. print stuff on your toast. 
2. Print Ads on your toast.
3. Profit. What!? 

See https://toasteroid.com/

I imagine a (dystopian?) future where you have to pay a subscription fee to remove ads from your toast in the morning

This could be the IoT future we all hate.

# httpcache

A Transport for http.Client that will cache responses according to the HTTP RFC
