# In summary

-  compiled language checks a lot of errors for me
- statically compiled (single binary deployment!)
- strictly typed language
- excellent type system and OOP-like features (interfaces)
  - composition and embedding
- language grammer well defined
- language spec well defined https://golang.org/ref/spec
- amazing tooling (gofmt, godef, vim-go)
- small standard library and the go1 promise https://golang.org/doc/go1compat
- concurrency is a language (not library) feature
- concurrency, goroutines, channels
- it's good to collaborate on (e.g. writing large systems)
