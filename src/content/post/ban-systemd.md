why I want to ban systemd
=============================


1. the developers and members on the irc room are aggressive and counter productive and only seem to want to fight
   rather than try to solve any issue.

2. I read countless posts about the terrible nature of the developers

3. Linus Banned a developer for fighting

   From https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76935#c24

   ```
   Systemd needs to be forked NOW.
   Linus explained it well already:
   Kay and Lennart: please just go away, disappear from the FOSS community, we don't need you and your crap.
   ```
More updates to follow..
=============================

I'm pretty entertained but really saddened by the fact. I joined the IRC room to ask abuot a bug and only
got racial comments and vulgar language when I inquired about a bug. We didn't even get to discussing the
technical reasons, I had to leave the channel. I might try again later, I am curious.


The community needs to reject this overly complex piece of software without a clear focus or direction.
