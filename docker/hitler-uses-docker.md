    -------------------------------

    we pushed the images to dockerhub, then used docker-compose to deploy to the cluster

    we mounted data volumes on these nodes

    and linked app container here

    finally we've updated the DNS records


    hitler: so we're running 20 containers on every node now. when can we get rid of the excess servers?

    mein fuhrer...

    the kernel...
    A 3rd party container caused a panic...

    we've lost 70% of the cluster and the data volumes

    .... hitler loses his shit ....

    hitler: if you never used docker in production, leave the room now

    hitler: isolation my ass!

    hitler: what were you thinking?

    hitler: who the hell uses public containers from docker hub?

    hitler: for all you know they were made by russian hackers!

    hitler: you might as well use `curl | sudo bash`

    hitler: you think everything in public rpeo is secure because it's OSS?

    hitler: you're a bunch of node.js hipsters that just HAVE to install everything you read on hacker news!

    but docker allows us to run our applications anywhere!

    hitler: you use a VM just to run docker on your laptop!

    mein fuhrer, docker-machine uses a lightweight VM!

    hitler: do you hear yourself? why do we need docker if we're running a VM?

    hitler: a container inside a container!!!

    hitler: you archived a whole linux O/S then used CoW storage becaues it's too big

    hitler: Just so you can deploy a 10MB go Binary!

    hitler: Dont even talk to me about resource constraints

    hitler: all that cgroups black magic and it still can't stop a simple fork bomb!

    hitler: and if the database needs all the resources on the server, how exactly will docker allow you to run more programs on it?

    hitler: before docker, I just picked the right size VMs.

    hitler: Suddenly people talk to me about datacenter efficiency and "hyperconvergence"

    hitler: everybody thinkst they're google!

    hitler: you don't even run your own machines anymore!

    hitler: people run docker on GCE, in VM instances that run in linux containers on Borg!

    hitler: people even think docker is configuration management

    hitler: they think docker solves everything!

    hitler: even microsoft has containers now

    hitler: i'm moving everyone to windows!

    dont cry, you can run bash on windows 10 now

    hitler: docker is supposed to have better performance

    hitler: yet that fucker userland proxy is slower than a 28.8k modem

    hitler: and for what

    hitler: just bind on port 0

    hitler: even enterprises want to run docker now and they still have red hat 5 installed

    hitler: you idiots think docker will help your application scale

    hitler: use openstack for all I care
