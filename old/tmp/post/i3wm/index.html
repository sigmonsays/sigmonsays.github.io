of bash scripts I wrote myself and maintained over the years. This was because I started running the latest version of e from git.</p>
<p>If memory serves, I switched from fluxbox to enlightenment when enlightenment 0.17 came out, which was somewhere near the year 2012. Needless to say it
takes a lot to shift someone who has been using e for so long.</p>
<p>The primary reasons I used enlightenment were</p>
<ol>
<li>fast - configurable to be fast. I could disable the fancy animations</li>
<li>&ldquo;independent&rdquo; multi-monitor-workspaces - This is a real big one for me. It means that in a dual screen setup, you can switch a workspace on only a single monitor</li>
<li>scriptable - enlightenment_remoet allowed some scripting, this allowed automating desktop setup</li>
</ol>
<p><code>enter i3</code></p>
<p>i3 has been a bit of a learning curve being keyboard driven but I solved that by making a printable cheat sheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y3aRkCIa60fqLkAZWxMr8cJFo0wimqrmSUnWUmj7Hw4/edit?usp=sharing">see here</a></p>
<p>its controllable via i3-msg which are basically the same commands used in ~/.i3/config, so it is much more scriptable than enlightenment</p>
<p>being keyboard driven it allows me to switch workspaces and windows without ever leaving the home keys. This has huge implications on development workflows which
i&rsquo;ll get into later.</p>
