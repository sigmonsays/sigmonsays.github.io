      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have switched from enlightenment to i3wm and wanted to talk about my experiences. At the time I was compiling enlightenment from source using a terrible set&#xA;of bash scripts I wrote myself and maintained over the years. This was because I started running the latest version of e from git.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If memory serves, I switched from fluxbox to enlightenment when enlightenment 0.17 came out, which was somewhere near the year 2012. Needless to say it&#xA;takes a lot to shift someone who has been using e for so long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
