      <description>This is a simple idea I had while waiting for a build to complete.
The background Its common to use dpkg-buildpackage inside of a chroot managed by pdebuild. The pdebuild script takes a minimal base image tarball and installs all dependencies in it required to build your package.
The build dependencies come from debian/control Build-Depends section. The package being built is a python application using virtualenv. A lot of the packages come from apt however.</description>

      <description>While trying to determine the performance overhead of a simple docker container setup, I discovered several issues related to network performance.
two issues I have encountered
 docker-proxy handles local network traffic when using the hosts bridge IP (or localhost) connection tracking overhead of NAT increases memory usage  my setup
I am using docker containers as an easy way to deploy backends on a host. I wish to use the hosts bridge IP as a backend to route requests from the load balancer.</description>
