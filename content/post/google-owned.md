Ever think about how much information google has collected about you?

Apart from services there are additional things going on that you might not be aware of

# Location Services

In addition to GPS tracking, there is a service that runs on android phones and looks at available wifi networks to determine your location. This is usable when there isn't cell service.  However, the wifi networks are saved
and uploaded centrally to google. Nobody knows what and how this data is used. I do not want google or Macy's knowing if I happen to walk into their store and my wifi pings theirs.

# Photos

On top of facial recognition, there are other levels of processing performed.

They have ran extensive image processing on my photo library. I can ask google home to show me pictures of `pizza` and it shows mostly things similar to pizza
